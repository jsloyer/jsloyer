As [announced yesterday](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47185.wss), IBM has formed a partnership with [Box.com](http://Box.com), a partnership that includes the integration of Box into the Bluemix catalog. With its REST-based Content and View APIs, embedding enterprise-grade file storage into your app and enabling file sharing among your users has never been simpler.

To help you on your way to becoming a file-sharing guru, Bluemix developer advocate Jake Peyser and I have built a sample app that you can leverage as you begin to explore the possibilities of the [Box.com](http://box.com) APIs.<!-- more --> The video below shows the application and outlines the steps to create it:

If you want to follow _written_ step-by-step instructions on how we leveraged the [Box.com](http://box.com) and Watson Personality Insights services to create our app, see [Integrate Cloud File Storage and Sharing into your Bluemix App with Box](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/06/24/intro-to-box/). We encourage you to pick up where we left off and build on this sample!
