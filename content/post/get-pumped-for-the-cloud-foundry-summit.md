I’m pumped for the Cloud Foundry Summit! Are you??? Well if you aren’t yet hopefully you will be after reading this!

If you attended the conference last year there was an awesome presentation on the future of Diego.  What is Diego you ask?  It is the new DEA that is coming for Cloud Foundry.  It is a complete re-write in Go and will add some new features such as the ability to swap out the underlaying linux containers for things like Docker.  Additionally another huge win is adding in plugins, this will be awesome as well!

Additionally, there is always a cast of characters there…  [Angel Diaz](https://twitter.com/angelluisdiaz) (from IBM) is a great speaker and always pumps people up (literally).  You should ask him to arm wrestle you, I would lose…

Ok so for reals, what am I really excited about, well the tech, duh…  Here is a list of some of the sessions I am really pumped about and why.


### Sessions


  * [A Developer’s Perspective on Cloud Foundry Operations: One Month in the Trenches](http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/b9a2c4ad617e38167044bb9c42801438?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#.VUEDeK1Viko) by Cornelia Davis — Well this one is pretty obvious why, Cornelia is an awesome speaker and I am never let down by her talks, must see just for her.


  * [Rocking the Lattice: A New Path for Cloud Foundry Applications](https://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/73242303138c19c0bacac3e71cf62a12#.VUIwGq1VhBc) by James Bayer — Again probably the same reason as above, James is an awesome speaker and a must see


  * [Case Study: Lessons learned hosting a large, global Cloud Foundry deployments](http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/c8c7462b7d0e3775c14aec71bcdb75db?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#.VUEDqa1Viko) by Adam Gunther — This should be a good one, hosting and running a large scale Cloud Foundry deployment isn’t easy it will be interesting to learn some lessons learned.  Plus Adam is my new manager so I should probably show up so he has a plant in the audience…


  * [A glimpse at Runtime](http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/bb7647207209ec5d410011d67055d615?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#.VUEDtK1Viko) by Zachary Auerbach and Daniel Lavine — The runtime is probably the most important part of Cloud Foundry and its always nice to hear and see some of the inner workings of the runtime team, a must see…


  * [The Road to Persistence on Cloud Foundry Diego](http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/f81390f973280b917bf5833a808a3fe5?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#.VUEDwq1Viko) by Caleb Miles and Ted Young — This will be a good one, this talk is going to talk about a new model for the 12 factor app and more specifically some cool cluster scheduling systems like Apache Mesos.  I have friends at Twitter and the swear up and down on Mesos and how awesome is it.


  * [Finding and Organizing a Great Cloud Foundry User Group](http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/event/ba341002c205509deb3e6afe36df3da0?iframe=no&w=&sidebar=yes&bg=no#.VUHwD61Vikp) by Daniel Krook, Manuel Silveyra and Animesh Singh — Cloud Foundry wouldn’t be successful without its community.  These guys are going to be talking about how they have run and organized some of the most successful Cloud Foundry meetups in the Bay Area and NYC.


Again, get PUMPED!!!  I am all jacked up and ready to head to the CF Summit, better see you there.  If you come up to me at the Summit and yell out get pumped in front of me, I’ll buy you a beer or something…
