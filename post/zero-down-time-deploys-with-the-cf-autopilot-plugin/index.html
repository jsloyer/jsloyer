This will ensure that your app is horizontally scalable and can be deployed in a manner that will result in zero down time.  Below are some highlights that you should abide by.</p><ol><li><p>Do not store sessions on disk or in memory.  Store them in some type of shared database or file system.  This could be your favorite database or an in memory database as well.</p></li><li><p>Do not store configuration information in your application or on disk.  You should store your config info for your app in environment variables.</p></li><li><p>This is probably the most important, your application needs to be forward and backwards compatible with your database schema…  Say what?  Yes, you need to trust your developers to manage the database schema from your code.If you are using a relational database, you will need some kind of framework to do database migrations for you.  It’s not just that simple with relational databases though…  If you have a big database migration DO NOT PERORM MIGRATIONS THAT WILL INTERRUPT TRAFFIC!  Perform them slowly over time where migrations do not impact users and traffic.  Yahoo had a major application upgrade and it took them 6 months to do the migration to avoid impacting users and taking an outage.  Remember we do not take outages…  If you are in NoSQL land, your life is easier.  Just revision your API’s and educate your developers on forward and backwards data compatibility.</p></li></ol><h2 id=importance-of-zero-down-time-deployments>Importance of Zero Down Time Deployments</h2><p>So why are zero down time deployments so important?  The answer is simple, to keep your website/app up so you can make money!  Well that might be over-simplified a bit, but basically it all boils down to keeping your app up so you can continue to do what you do best, and hopefully that involves making money.  If you look at Facebook, for example, they put code into production weeks and months before a feature is exposed to the public.  They extensively test the features on employees first, then slowly enable the features to the rest of the world.</p><p>This is key, getting features in front of your customers and getting feedback from them.  If it works that’s great, but if it doesn’t at least you know in a short time frame so you can remove it and pivot to go in a different direction.  The current landscape is so fast paced that if you don’t get a feature out, your competition could beat you.</p><h2 id=how-does-it-work>How does it work?</h2><p>So let’s walk through what needs to happen to perform zero downtime deployments in Cloud Foundry.  For the use of the walk-through, the application is currently taking traffic on <code>myapp.mybluemix.net</code>.</p><ol><li><p>Deploy your app or use a currently running app.
Currently your application is taking traffic on <code>myapp.mybluemix.net</code>.
<a class=link href=zero-downtime-graphics.001.png><img src=/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.001.png width=1024 height=768 srcset="/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.001_hu_67a6719a618981e5.png 480w, /post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.001_hu_9cf09c6100caf55a.png 1024w" loading=lazy alt="zero downtime graphics.001 Zero Down Time Deploys with the CF Autopilot Plugin" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=133 data-flex-basis=320px></a></p></li><li><p>Deploy the new version of your app to <code>myapp-temp.mybluemix.net</code>.
At this time there is currently two versions of your app running.  <code>myapp.mybluemix.net</code> is still taking production traffic.
The new app <code>myapp-temp.mybluemix.net</code> is separate, it can be pointed to your production API keys and databases at this point.
<a class=link href=zero-downtime-graphics.002.png><img src=/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.002.png width=1024 height=768 srcset="/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.002_hu_eb1fe4ca1db1eba1.png 480w, /post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.002_hu_f8db8cd111c0f3e7.png 1024w" loading=lazy alt="zero downtime graphics.002 Zero Down Time Deploys with the CF Autopilot Plugin" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=133 data-flex-basis=320px></a></p></li><li><p>Perform smoke tests on the new version of the application.
Some people say this step is optional, but to me its not.  This is key to make sure there wasn’t any weird regressions or merge issues, they CAN happen…</p></li><li><p>Map production traffic to the new version of your app.
At this point the old version of your app and the new version are both taking production traffic.
<a class=link href=zero-downtime-graphics.003.png><img src=/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.003.png width=1024 height=768 srcset="/post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.003_hu_63c6b419a410167d.png 480w, /post/zero-down-time-deploys-with-the-cf-autopilot-plugin/zero-downtime-graphics.003_hu_17ea991aa50404ca.png 1024w" loading=lazy alt="zero downtime graphics.003 Zero Down Time Deploys with the CF Autopilot Plugin" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=133 data-flex-basis=320px></a></p></li><li><p>Unmap production traffic from the old version of the app.  You can optionally delete the old version as well.
At this point the new version becomes production and ONLY it is taking traffic.
The new version still has two URL’s though, <code>myapp.mybluemix.net</code> and <code>myapp-temp.mybluemix.net</code>.
